The study of evolution aims to understand the myriads of diversity in existence today and how they came to be. An essential part of this task requires understanding the genetic processes and patterns that occur in and define populations. Population genetics coalesced as a field in the early 1900s, following more than a decade of controversy and debate over the process of evolution \citep{Provine:2001}. Since its advent, great insight has been made into the processes that contribute to the evolution of populations and species. Our understandings of genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, and selection have created a solid foundation for the growing field of evolutionary biology. Yet as the field has advanced, the realization that the manifold and minute complexities of these processes can immensely impact populations and species has left open questions in the field of evolutionary biology.

One of the interesting complexities in understanding population genetics is the role of demographic history. Though population genetics eponymously (\color{red}wrong word?\color{black}) uses genetic data both in theory and empirically to understand the process of evolution, informing such genetic data with ecological demographic information is often, if not always, necessary. Without this combination of information, it is nearly impossible to gain a full understanding of the ancestral processes leading to the current state of the system at hand and the future trajectories this system may follow. Effective population size makes an exemplar description of this situation. Census size of many organisms can be obtained, as this simply requires counting all individuals present in a population (though for many reasons, census size can often be the more difficult quantity to obtain). However census size alone does not generally inform long term processes occurring in a population nor how the population may evolve. Genetic data is necessary for such insight. For example, a large number of individuals might be present at any given time due to stochastic events such as increase in resources, rather than reflecting consistently large numbers of individuals. Likewise a small number of individuals might be found if other stochastic abiotic factors such as a recent catastrophic storm lead to the death of many individuals. In these instances, defining a population by its effective size is more useful and can reveal information that the census size does not. 

The effective population size is a key parameter in population genetics and evolution. Defined by \citet{Wright:1931} as the size of an ideal population that experiences the same level of genetic drift as the given population, effective population size informs how populations are likely to respond to evolutionary forces, or even what forces are likely to occur. Small populations are more subject to random genetic drift, while in larger populations selection is known to be more effective at acting to remove deleterious genetic material and increase the frequency of beneficial alleles in populations \citep{Gravel:2016}. This impacts the likelihood of new mutations establishing or being lost within a population (\color{red}citation\color{black}). All three of these factors contribute to local differentiation of populations, but the fourth evolutionary process, gene flow, can be a major disruptive force in this process by introducing foreign and sometimes maladaptive individuals \citep{Slatkin:1987}. Whether migration into a population results in successful gene flow is linked to effective size in terms of whether selection is sufficiently strong to remove these introduced individuals, or whether populations are so small that gene flow acts to sustain an otherwise extinction-bound population by introducing genetic variation and increasing the effective size. Sewall Wright aptly describes his thoughts at the time on the interplay of effective population size with the evolutionary process:
\begin{quoteshrink}
  ``A much more favorable condition [for evolution] would be that of a large population, broken up into imperfectly isolated local strains. \ldots The rate of evolutionary change depends primarily on the balance between the effective size of population in the local strain and the amount of interchange of individuals with the species as a whole and is therefore not limited by mutation rates.''
  \hfill\citet{Wright:1930}
\end{quoteshrink}

Demographic history is a vital factor in the above processes. Knowing the correct demographic history of a population can affect the ability of many genetic analysis methods to correctly infer a parameter of interest. For example, if a population under study recently underwent a vicariance event and was previously part of a much larger population, the genetic patterns seen may still reflect that of the larger population. Making conservation decisions based on an incorrectly overestimated effective population size in this instance could be detrimental. The aim of my thesis is to investigate the interplay of demographic history with population genetic processes and patterns.

In \Chapref{effectivepopsize} I investigate the impact of migration on leading to incorrect estimation of effective population sizes through genetic data analysis. Estimating and knowing the effective population size is key in conservation biology and leads to many political decisions in terms of when and where to conserve populations at risk. Misunderstanding of the effective size may thus lead to the local, or even global, extinction of species in the most extreme cases. Using simulated data and testing pre-existing methods developed in order to estimate effective population size allowed each of these methods to be equivalently tested across common demographic scenarios. Use of simulated data benefits this investigation by having knowledge of the true effective population size, which otherwise in nature is never truly possible.

A major goal of evolutionary biology today is to identify the loci that contribute to local adaptation of populations \citep{Savolainen:2013, Whitlock:2015, LeCorre:2012, Coop:2010}. Demographic history is, however, one of the leading causes of the misidentification of adaptive loci \citep{Whitlock:2015}(\color{red}other refs?\color{black}). Local adaptation is an important in the process of evolution for many reason. Adapting to the local environment is what allows many species to exist across a range of conditions. In some cases, local adaptation can also be considered an early stage in the process of speciation, contributing to differentiation among populations that eventually become reproductively isolated. In today's world of climate change and other anthropogenic forces fragmenting or altering species native environments, understanding the ability of populations to adapt is key to maintaining diversity. In addition to the utility of this knowledge in an applied sense, understanding the maintenance of genetic diversity across populations has been a longstanding question in evolutionary biology:
\begin{quoteshrink}
  ``The roles of local fitness peaks and gene flow in adaptive evolution remain major open questions in evolutionary biology, nearly a century after Wright first raised the issue.''
  \hfill\citet{Barton:2016}
\end{quoteshrink}

To best understand local adaptation, we rely on empirical data from natural species. Transplant studies and common gardens have contributed a great deal to identifying the presence of local adaptation within species. Finding the genetic loci that contribute to this adaptation is a complicated endeavor. Before considering the difficulties due to identifying the correct loci instead of the incorrect ones, there is a first problem that is detecting loci contributing to a trait at all. Ample research has been devoted to finding whether adaptation is due mainly to few loci of large allelic effects or many loci of small effects(\color{red}citations\color{black}). Our current genetic and genomic technology combined with available statistical methods make the identification of small effect loci very difficult (\color{red}citations\color{black}). Therefore, finding few loci that contribute to an adaptive trait may be the correct biological answer, but may also be a detection error where small effect loci are missed as false negatives.

Apart from detection issues, evolutionary processes themselves may lead to false inference of loci under selection. A common method for identifying loci important in local adaptation is by environment-allele correlations. In these analyses, when certain alleles correlate to certain environmental conditions, they are predicted to be adaptive in those environments. Similarly, genetic clines over space that correlate with clines in environmental conditions are considered as adaptive. Inferring selection for these alleles is not unfounded, but recent years' research has shown that selection is not the only process capable of leading to these genetic patterns. Neutral processes such as genetic drift are equally possible causes for such a pattern, in particular when populations have non-equilibrium demographic histories. (\color{red}citations for this whole paragraph\color{black})

An quintessential example of demographic history interacting with detection of loci under selection is that of species range expansions. Many species in the northern hemisphere have expanded northward after the last glaciation to recolonize previously uninhabitable terrain. This expansion process has left many populations out of equilibria. Range expansions can lead to a completely neutral genetic process that leaves a genetic signature in populations identical to that of selection on those loci. During range expansions, the expanding front continually colonizes new habitat. These front edge populations are thus consistently at lower effective population sizes. At the range edge, the strength of selection is reduced and genetic drift predominates. This can lead to the loss or fixation of alleles of various effects, beneficial or deleterious.  The repetition of this process during expansion has been termed gene surfing \citep{Klopfstein:2006}. As such alleles surf along the expanding front, this can leave behind the signature of a genetic cline, and this cline results from a purely neutral process during expansion. When such an expansion occurs over an environmental gradient, as is the case for northward expansion of species over latitudinal gradients in climate, this spatial autocorrelation of alleles with environmental conditions can lead many inferences of loci under selection astray \citep{Whitlock:2015}.

Understanding the process of local adaptation during range expansions can contribute to our understanding of local adaptation in general. In \Chapref{heterogeneouslandscapes} and \Chapref{expansionload} I present studies examining this process. \Chapref{heterogeneouslandscapes} examines how range expansions over heterogeneous, patchy landscapes impacts the ability of populations to adapt to the local environment.

A major question has emerged in the field of evolutionary biology and population genetics over the past decade: how do natural selection and past demographic history interact to shape current genetic diversity of populations and species? Researchers have come to realize that these two processes are not separate actions on the genome, but are instead intricately linked. Selective and neutral processes can occur concurrently and can often be incredibly difficult to disentangle. Recent studies1,2,3,4 provide examples of loci under selection that contribute to adaptation, and increasing amounts of genomic data allow for an improved understanding of the forces creating, maintaining, or eliminating genetic diversity. Disentangling the respective role of selection and demography is fundamental. Identifying loci that truly contribute to adaptation and determining when selection is most effective on the genome have implications for eliminating or combatting diseases, controlling invasive species, and ensuring the survival of species in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic environmental changes.

Demographic history contributes to every population's current genetic makeup. For example, population bottlenecks, demographic growth, admixture, or migration events all leave different genetic signatures in populations. Methods exist to infer such histories5,6, but it has recently been discovered that some demographic histories, particularly range expansions, can leave genetic signatures identical to others, confounding our ability to infer a population's past and what has contributed to its present and future. During a species range expansion, founding populations of small size at the expanding front experience a process termed gene surfing7, which can increase the frequency of neutral variants above expectation in newly colonized habitats, and look very much like an event of positive selection8. This same process can also result in the increase of deleterious variants that confer a mutational burden on populations and prevent their expansion or adaptation9 to new conditions due to the reduced efficiency of selection in small populations at range edges. The importance of these spatial expansions on the genetic diversity of populations has only recently been identified. Furthermore, a related demographic history of a range shift, where the entirety of a species range moves over space expanding at the front and receding at the trailing edge, has not been investigated in terms of its potential effects on population diversity. Furthering our understanding of these processes and their impact on species diversity will thus be a great advancement of the fields of evolutionary biology and population genetics.

% Population genetics as a field is experiencing a stimulating period of research. Genomic capabilities have advanced at astonishing speeds and continue to do so, providing easy access into insights previously beyond the reach of researchers studying non-model organisms. Simultaneously, the world is facing rapid environmental changes due to causes such as climate change and anthropogenic forces that result in habitat fragmentation, invasive species, or other harmful actions on species. Combined, these two factors mean that not only are we in desperate need of understanding the processes underlying evolution in changing environments to preserve biodiversity into the future, but we are also increasingly able to accomplish exactly these goals. However, despite the increasing ease of data generation, inferential methods and analyses require analogous advances to succeed in expanding our knowledge on evolutionary processes and patterns.
% In this thesis, I present my research which has touched in part on all of these topics. I have assessed the capabilities of methods for estimating effective population size to function accurately in the presence of migration, a factor which can skew estimation results in unexpected ways due to allele frequency changes. I have performed a validation study of genetic loci identified through genome wise associations and environment-allele correlations to test for the presence of false positives. And I have performed simulation studies to elucidate the intricacies of species range expansions and the role of heterogeneously changing environmental gradients, mutation load, and migration load on preventing or enhancing range expansions.

%Population size is a defining characteristic in countless ways. Census size of populations at the broadest level can describe the density at which species exist. Yet often, even describing what a population itself is can be a difficult task. One of the most essential parameters in evolutionary biology however, is the effective population size. This measure of a population is defined by the amount of genetic drift a population experiences. It describes the genetic diversity present, and thus how likely the population is to persist into the future. Effective population size further relates to many major evolutionary processes

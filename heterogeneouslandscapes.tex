\chapter{Genetic architecture and landscape patchiness impact adaptation during species range expansion}%The role of genetic architecture and environmental gradients in adaptation during range expansion}
\label{chap:heterogeneouslandscapes}

\section{Abstract}
Range expansions are complex evolutionary and ecological processes. From an evolutionary standpoint, a populations' adaptive capacity is a major factor in determining the success or failure of expansion. Using individual-based simulations we model range expansion over a two-dimensional, approximately continuous landscape. We investigate the ability for populations to adapt across patchy environmental gradients. We also examine the effects of genetic architecture for a quantitative trait with loci ranging from small to large effect sizes in influencing the ability to adapt to novel environments during range expansion. We find that landscape patchiness and genetic architecture both have the ability to change the outcome of adaptation and expansion over the landscape. Many mutations of small effect or few of large effect allow successful adaptation to newly encountered environments, but the intermediate between these extremes makes adaptation most difficult and can prevent range expansion. Increasingly steep linear gradients prevent range expansion, while partitioning an overall gradient into local patches with sharp changes in phenotypic optimum hinders range expansion by making adaptation to each novel environment more difficult. This effectively reduces the overall gradient for which expansion is able to succeed across. %% have less about previous studies - that goes in intro, here be explicit about what we did and found


\section{Introduction}

%discuss the question of adaptation broadly - it's important in many aspects of evolution
The ability for populations to adapt to novel environments has been studied in evolutionary biology for decades. Understanding populations' abilities to adapt to novel environments is key to understanding range expansions; this has been a major area of study across evolutionary biology in studies of speciation, local adaptation, invasive species, and conservation biology \citep{Stapley:2010, Sexton:2009}. Populations can locally adapt within their species range to survive across a range of disparate environments \citep{Kawecki:2004}, but why populations cannot always continue to locally adapt past a range edge and expand is unclear \citep{Bridle:2007}. The capacity for adaptation to new environments has important implications for the capacity of invasive species to thrive \citep{Prentis:2008} and the potential for success of new genetic diversity from attempts of assisted migration \citep{Aitken:2013}. 

% range expansions 
Adaptation during range expansions has been examined in great detail. Foundational theoretical work on adaptation and range expansions over environmental gradients has shown that, on a linear environmental gradient, increasing the steepness of change in environmental optimum leads to maladaptation at the margin and eventual extinction of the species \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997}. Further investigations have shown the effects of density dependent selection \citep{GarciaRamos:1997} as well as stochastic effects on low density \citep{Bridle:2010}, temporal changes in environments \citep{Pease:1989}, differing dispersal parameters \citep{Aguilee:2012}, evolution of genetic variance \citep{Barton:2001,Polechova:2009}, and the impacts of genetic drift  \citep{Polechova:2015} on adaptation or the lack thereof at range margins. 

These studies have all investigated adaptation in models of linear environmental gradients in continuous space. Further theoretical studies have investigated adaptation across two disparate patches different environmental optima. \citet{Ronce:2001} showed that if selection is strong enough within each habitat or migration reduced enough, this can prevent the establishment of foreign alleles in a new population allowing it to adapt sufficiently to local conditions. Others have shown that evolutionary rescue from migration into marginal populations of small effective population sizes, which otherwise behave as sinks, can then reach a self-sustaining level, adapt, and persist \citep{Holt:1997,Gomulkiewicz:1999,Ching:2012}. The level of gene flow among populations can greatly affect the outcome for adaptation and range expansion. On a linear gradient, higher gene flow has been shown to introduce more maladaptive alleles from greater distances and thus be more detrimental to the local population \citep{GarciaRamos:1997}.

The structure of a landscape relates to the effects of gene flow in adapting to the local environment. These previous studies have investigated range expansions across linear gradients and adaptation across two patches in space, but the intermediate scenario of environments that change heterogeneously over space adds biological realism. Real world environments are often more complex than linear gradients of environmental change. Environments are heterogeneous and can change in multifarious ways over space, from gradual to sudden, and of minor or major magnitudes of change over space. Species are known to exist across gradients of many types, from elevational \citep{Stevens:1992, Wilson:2005} to latitudinal \citep{Gaston:2009}. Changes in temperature or other environmental variables can occur heterogeneously in space \citep{Pickett:1997}, for example with bioclimatic regions, patches of forest or meadow, elevational gradients with distinct regions of environments such as above or below the timberline, or changes in soil conditions along slopes. Lastly, species are also known to exist across scenarios similar to two-patch models, for example plants living on and off patches of serpentine soils \citep{Brady:2005}. %% add element of continuous dispersal with discrete env boundaries
These differences in landscape structure play a key role in the adaptation process of populations, because of their potential to interact with evolutionary processes at the range margin. We can thus hypothesize that heterogeneous landscapes may potentially change outcomes of adaptation beyond expectations from either of these previous models. %% which? reword to something like 'linear cline models'

When discrete habitat types exist contiguously across space, %%come up with a simpler phrase
it is not known if the dynamics will reflect a the continuous linear gradient or discrete models. \citet{Barton:2001} suggested populations can persist across environments of accelerating gradients, but in depth examination of different types of environmental heterogeneities is warranted. \citet{Schiffers:2014} have investigated the role of adaptation across two habitat types distributed in patches over the environment and found that the coarseness of environmental change must match the coarseness of the system's genetic architecture. 
%% we may want a separate paragraph to discuss genetic effects
This study did not extend into investigations of environmental heterogeneity over a large-scale gradient. With larger environmental differences in optima, it is not known if large effect mutations are needed to contribute to local adaptation or if many small effect alleles can still lead to successful adaptation across a species range.

% first sentence is clunky:
When considering environmental heterogeneity in terms of adaptation during range expansions, there are several important genetic processes that can lead to interesting hypotheses for adaptation across the landscape, making range expansions ideal for studying the combination of these effects. 
% second sentence doesn't follow neatly from previous sentence
The characteristics of the environment available for a species to expand into plays an important role in the ability of populations to expand \citep{Aguilee:2012, Barton:2001, Pease:1989}. Increasing habitat heterogeneity, and thus heterogeneity in selective pressures, interacts with gene flow to affect the adaptability of peripheral populations and can in some cases inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987,Kirkpatrick:1997, Ronce:2001}. 
%%MCW remove: When gene surfing occurs during range expansions, it is also possible for neutral processes to alter allele frequencies at the range edge in directions opposed to those of selection for local adaptation \citep{Klopfstein:2006, Peischl:2013, Peischl:2015, Excoffier:2009}. 
Due to reduced density at range margins, edge populations experience gene flow at much higher proportions than populations existing within the denser core of the species range. This asymmetric migration can behave in two disparate ways: introducing new genetic variation needed for further adaptation in an otherwise genetically depauperate population, or swamping locally adaptive alleles with foreign maladaptive alleles thus preventing further adaptation. Which of these occurs will depend on the details of migration rates, mutation rates, population sizes, and the degree to which the environment differs across the species range.
%% ^^ the point of this paragraph is not clear


% talk about genetic architecture
The genetic basis of local adaptation is also important \citep{Stapley:2010}. Many studies, both empirical and theoretical, examine genetic architecture and its role in the ability to adapt to a novel environment \citep{Yeaman:2015, Yeaman:2011, Carroll:2001, Holloway:1990, Peichel:2001, Bratteler:2006, Schiffers:2014}. %% vague
A sufficient level of genetic variation, $V_G$, is necessary to provide the alleles required for adapting to a new environment. It was previously thought that many alleles of small effect may be swamped by gene flow before being able to contribute to sufficient local adaptation \citep{Tigano:2016}, but local adaptation via many genes of small effect is possible \citep{Yeaman:2015, LeCorre:2012}. As shown by \citet{Yeaman:2015}, this occurs through transient processes subject to random genetic drift when rates and sizes of mutations and genetic redundancy are sufficient (though detecting the presence of such alleles remains a difficult task). It is clear however, that fewer loci of larger effect can contribute most easily to adaptation, which eventually lead to the building up of linked clusters of locally adapted alleles, often referred to as genomic islands of divergence \citep{Feder:2010}. Empirical studies have also demonstrated adaptation via many loci of small effect \citep{Buckler:2009}. Even when small effect alleles may initially contribute to adaptation, larger effect alleles are expected to accumulate over time and contribute to adaptive differences among populations \citep{Yeaman:2011}. As \citet{Renaut:2013} have shown in sunflower species, genetic architecture plays a larger role in contributing to genomic divergence of species than does the level of geographic isolation for speciation. %% MCW still doesn't understand this sentence
The details of genetic architecture are thus vital in studies of adaptation. Investigating various types of genetic architecture with studies of range expansions may have broad implications for understanding how species will be able to cope with global climate change. 
% talk about range expansions over linear gradients



In this study, we address two main questions. First, do predictions of range expansion from a linear gradient successfully extrapolate to a patchy gradient which changes in discrete jumps. And second, does the genetic architecture of the system change the conditions for successful range expansion. 
%% MCW - not sure this is necessary: We extend the model of \citet{Schiffers:2014} to a much larger scale of species range expansions to test if different genetic architectures and landscape heterogeneities can interact and affect the outcome of adaptation during a species range expansion. 
We simulate range expansion across a spatially explicit and discrete two-dimensional landscape with individual-based, forward time simulations in the program \textsc{nemo} \citep{Guillaume:2006}. We vary two main parameters of interest: the heterogeneity of change in environmental optimum in space and the genetic architecture underlying the quantitative trait that allows adaptation to the local environment. We model a range of genetic architectures for a quantitative trait to examine potential differences in ability to adapt to environments that change heterogeneously in space. Examining the rate of range expansion and the time required for populations to colonize and adapt in new environments provides insight into the role of both genetic architecture and environmental heterogeneity in determining the success or failure of adaptation across a species range. 

%%Our goal is to understand the impact and interactions of genetic architecture and the landscape heterogeneity over which individuals exist in terms of the outcome of range expansion and population adaptation.



 %%Such results are highly informative for the field of evolutionary biology, and largely applicable in predicting the fate of many species across the globe requiring the ability to adapt in the face of disturbance and shifting species ranges due to climate change and other anthropogenic environmental perturbations.

% marginal populations thus often exist only as a sink, sustained by immigration until sufficient local adaptation is achieved. % and recovery from expansion load? -- refer to Ch 4 here, i.e. refer to our group project paper -- or just talk less about load since I'm not studying it in this paper
% When the population shifts to be a self-sustaining source, it escapes the effects of drift, and provides emigrants for further colonization and range expansion. This shift from sink to source also includes a shift away from asymmetric migration previously swamping locally adaptive alleles with foreign maladaptive alleles.

%Local adaptation within a species not only benefits populations in terms of fitness but also has repercussions for a species' global range. A species' range is defined in some cases by sharp visible boundaries, such as distinct geographical changes in landscape features, or equally understandable ecological reasons such as competitor occurrence or nutrient limitations. In instances where no such clear reason for a range edge exists, understanding what forces limit expansion and adaptation at the edge of a range becomes an evolutionary question \citep{Bridle:2007,Kawecki:2008,Excoffier:2009}. Barriers to dispersal may prevent expansion past the edge, however gene flow can also act to inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987,Kirkpatrick:1997}. This, in combination with different selective forces from environmental gradients across the landscape, may prevent expansion. The characteristics of the environment available for a species to expand into plays an important role \citep{Aguilee:2012,Barton:2001,Pease:1989}. Increasing habitat heterogeneity, and thus heterogeneity in selective pressures, interacts with gene flow to influence the adaptive abilities of peripheral populations \citep{Ronce:2001}.

% Under one of the first models to examine the question of adaptation across species ranges \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997}, it was shown that three different scenarios could result: species extinction, a limited species range, or unlimited expansion of a species. Other studies have examined scenarios similar to this model and incorporated more realistic simulation methods that were previously not investigated: density dependent selection \citep{GarciaRamos:1997,Gomulkiewicz:1999} as well as stochastic effects on low density \citep{Bridle:2010}, temporal changes in environments \citep{Pease:1989}, differing dispersal parameters \citep{Aguilee:2012}, and evolution of genetic variance \citep{Barton:2001,Polechova:2009}. \citet{Case:2000} also incorporated species competition, under which they found similar results only with a shallower environmental gradient needed to limit range expansion. Some of these models use the same linear gradient of an environmental optimum changing at a constant rate over continuous space, while others simulate adaptation to differing environmental optima across discrete space (habitat patches) within which  individuals of a patch possess no explicit spatial designation. The results of these discrete environment models also show the potential for species to either adapt and persist, exist as non-adapted generalists, or go extinct.

%Equally relevant to studying adaptation in a local adaptation or speciation context, is the study of adaptation during a species range expansion. As a species range expands, it encounters novel habitat to which it must adapt. Previous studies have shown that it is the ability of populations at range edges to adapt to these new environments that can determine the ability of a range to expand (citations). Not unlike parapatric speciation, this adaptation to new environments must occur in the presence of gene flow. Asymmetric gene flow at a range edge, however, can cause migration load that is particularly strong when an edge population is still a sink and requiring the influx of individuals to persist.

%Species range limits and the capacity for range expansion has long been a question in evolutionary biology. A species' range is defined in some cases by sharp visible boundaries, such as distinct geographical changes in landscape features, or equally understandable ecological reasons such as competitor occurrence or nutrient limitations. In instances where no such clear reason for a range edge exists, understanding what forces limit expansion and adaptation at the edge of a range becomes an evolutionary question \citep{Bridle:2007, Kawecki:2008, Excoffier:2009}. Barriers to dispersal may prevent expansion past the edge, however gene flow can also act to inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987, Kirkpatrick:1997}. This, in combination with different selective forces from environmental gradients across the landscape, may prevent expansion.

\section{Methods}

We implement a modified version of \textsc{nemo} \citep{Guillaume:2006}, described in Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\Chapref{expansionload}), which allows continuous space to be approximated by a discrete, two-dimensional species range. This expands greatly upon existing 2-patch models with non-explicit space within each landscape patch and approaches a model of continuous space. Individuals are monoecious (hermaphroditic), obligately outcrossing diploids which possess a quantitative trait under balancing selection for the local environmental optimum. We initiate the population in a limited spatial region for a burn-in to migration-mutation-selection equilibrium, after which populations expand into empty landscape of various types of heterogeneous environmental optima. Generations are non-overlapping, and life cycle events occur in the order of breeding, dispersal, viability selection, and population regulation. We monitor the populations' abilities to spread across the landscape, and when successful, compare these scenarios in terms of expansion speed and fitness as they encounter environments of differing environmental optima to which they must adapt in order to further expand.

\subsection{Landscapes}

To approximate continuous space and maintain a spatially explicit landscape with discrete populations, we implemented a large spatial grid of habitat patches in \textsc{nemo}. This bridges the gap between existing two-patch landscape models, where existence within either of these two patches is not spatially defined, and models of continuous space. The landscape is a rectangular grid of $40\times2000$ cells with a defined phenotypic optimum and carrying capacity for every cell in the landscape. We term the leftmost $40\times40$ cells of the landscape the core, which is where the burn-in period occurs. After burn-in, expansion proceeds along the long ($x$) axis of the landscape into the remaining $40\times1960$ cells. The core consistently possessed a constant optimum phenotypic value of $0$ to ensure that the population was well-adapted before populations expanded onto environmental gradients. In all cases, the environmental optimum only changed in one dimension over the axis of expansion ($x$-axis) and was constant over cross-sections of the landscape ($y$-axis). We thus average all values across the $40$-cell $y$-axis into a single value for a cross section at each location $x$ on the landscape. Terms for describing these landscape and other parameters are defined in Table \ref{tab:params}.

We examined several types of environmental heterogeneities across landscapes. These range from a linear gradient to two patches, as well as combinations in between having multiple patches of constant environmental optima interspersed by sharp changes in the environment. We model landscapes of heterogeneous environmental gradients possessing patches of constant phenotypic optima interspersed by changes in phenotypic optima over the landscape. 

To define each type of heterogeneous landscape, we describe three parameters: the width of patches over the landscape, the magnitude of change in optima between each of these patches, and the total gradient value across the landscape, which can be calculated from the previous two values since the landscape is of a constant size. The total gradient value, $b$, on the landscape is measured as the total change in phenotypic optima over the landscape divided by the length of the landscape (measured by number of cross sections, 1960). We refer to each local change in environmental optima on the landscape as $\Delta z_{opt}$. This value measures the magnitude of change in phenotypic optima between two patches. Patches are defined as a contiguous region of cross sections for which the phenotypic optima is constant on the landscape. The number of times that $\Delta z_{opt}$ changes over the entire landscape is equal to the total length of the landscape minus the core region ($1960$) divided by patch width. Figure \ref{fig:stepschematic} shows a schematic for a simplified landscape. We approximate a linear gradient with $1960$ patches on the landscape, each with a width of one cross section, which is much narrower than the dispersal kernel.

% maybe move to results
The steepness of a linear gradient at which range expansion is no longer possible is referred to as $b_{crit}$ \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997, Barton:2001, Bridle:2010}. We first model linear gradients to determine the critical value, $b_{crit}$ for which expansion could no longer occur. Following this, we then fragment the same total gradient into increasingly larger patches with higher values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ to test at what point $b_{crit}$ is changed by patchy environments. For this analysis, we held the total gradient value constant, but changed the width of patches and the $\Delta z_{opt}$ between each. To understand why the observed $b_{crit}$ from a linear gradient does not hold, we then investigate the role of $\Delta z_{opt}$ alone on a two-patch landscape, and then elucidate the interaction of $\Delta z_{opt}$ with patch width in allowing adaptation and expansion to proceed across the landscape. 
All results present  the average value for a given parameter across the $y$-axis of the landscape for any given landscape location $x$. %%MCW not clear here


\subsection{Breeding \& Dispersal}
%%  reword this to focus on the discrete representation of a continuous dispersal kernel.  It is not to maintain a larger NE, but to mimic continuous space
The large landscape grid allows a discrete approximation to continuous space by implementing breeding and dispersal kernels over a fine scale landscape grid. Each landscape cell has a local carrying capacity set at $K = 5$. Breeding and dispersal both occur in windows over regions of nearby cells, % mike wanted to add the word multiple here, I think that's implied by cells being plural and saying regions of cells
maintaining populations at larger effective population sizes. Neighborhood size is approximately $250$ individuals, as calculated from \citet{Wright:1946}. %% mention the larger disp kernel size- MCW

The breeding window we introduced into \textsc{nemo} defines a given radius of cells around a focal cell from which an individual can find a potential mate and is described in detail in Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\Chapref{expansionload}). Breeding is thus not limited to an individual cell. Lone colonists on the range front can still potentially find a nearby mate, even if they are the sole inhabitant of their cell. This most closely resembles obligately outcrossing plants, who may receive pollen from nearby mates, but could also represent animals that search for mates nearby then return to their home territory or scenarios where females are resident with roaming males. The probability a female mates with a given individual within her breeding window is described by an approximate bivariate Gaussian function. The size of this breeding window is defined by one standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution, $\sigma_{breed}$, where $f(x,y) \propto \exp{[-(\frac{\Delta x^2}{2\sigma_{breed}^2}+\frac{\Delta y^2}{2\sigma_{breed}^2})]}$ gives the relative probability of mating with an individual at a given distance $x$ and $y$. We discretized these probabilities by integrating the probability over each cell and assigning each potential mate within the window a chance to father offspring proportional to its distance. $\sigma_{breed}$ was set at one half of a cell width, and the maximum search radius for a mate was limited to $4\sigma_{breed}$. This produced a breeding window containing the $13$ cells: the focal cell and its $12$ surrounding cells. Individual fecundity was drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean $4$.

Dispersal occurred similarly to breeding, where a dispersal kernel was defined for forward rates of migration and discretized over cells on the landscape. This distribution was defined by $\sigma_{disperse} = 2$ cell widths for the small dispersal kernel and $\sigma_{disperse} = 4$ cell widths for the large dispersal kernel. An R wrapper package was created to calculate breeding and dispersal kernels, and to discretize these probabilities across the landscape, and is available online at https://github.com/kjgilbert/aNEMOne. C++ code for the modified version of \textsc{nemo} with a breeding window is available online at https://github.com/kjgilbert/NemoDispersalKernel.

 
\subsection{Viability Selection}
Selection occured only on survivorship, and not fecundity. Selection is stabilizing for the local environment's phenotypic optimum, with fitness of an individual defined by $w_z = exp[-\frac{(z-z_{opt})^2}{2 \omega^2}]$, where $z$ is the quantitative trait value, $z_{opt}$ is the optimum phenotypic trait for a given cell on the landscape, and $\omega^2$ defines the width of the fitness function. We scale phenotypic units in terms of environmental variance. 
%% REWORD: add more details or delete after gilbert et al
With environmental variance, $V_E$, set to $1$, there is evidence that a heritability of $\sim\frac{1}{3}$ is calculated to give $\omega^2$ equal to $7.5$. This is derived fully in Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\Chapref{expansionload}), as follows from \citet{Kingsolver:2001, Johnson:2005, Mousseau:1987, Houle:1992}. 


\subsection{Genetic Architecture} % integrate this section into the above
Individual phenotypes are defined by a quantitative trait that experiences stabilizing selection to adapt to the local environment. The quantitative trait, $z$, is controlled by 100 freely recombining loci. We held the total mutational variance, $V_m$, constant at $10^{-2}$, but varied the underlying genetic architectures contributing to the mutational variance. The number of loci, $L$, was also held constant at 100. Therefore, to satisfy $V_m = 2 L \mu \alpha^2$ \citep{Lande:1975}, we varied the per locus mutation rate, $\mu$, and the variance in mutational effect sizes, $\alpha^2$. Four regimes of genetic architecture were investigated that range from high mutation rate and low variance in mutational effect size to low mutation rate and high variance in mutational effect size. The ``small effect" regime set $\mu = 10^{-2}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.005$, the ``medium-small effect" regime set $\mu = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$, the ``medium-large effect" regime set $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$, and the ``large effect" regime set $\mu = 10^{-5}$ and $\alpha^2 = 5.0$. Though the large effect regime has the potential for mutations of much larger effect sizes, small effect mutations are not excluded. For a subset of simulations, we also compared the effect of holding $V_G$ constant. This was done by holding $\mu$ constant at $10^{-5}$ and only varying $\alpha^2$ at $5, 0.5$, and $0.05$.


\subsection{Analyses}

We quantify range expansion with two main measures: the growth rate of the entire metapopulation on the landscape and the time at which populations remain stationary before expanding into a patch they have encountered. Growth rate provides the most accurate measure of populations moving across the landscape within the confines of \textsc{nemo} and is further useful because it correlates closely to population fitness. The faster that populations expand, the higher their fitness is during this expansion. Away from the expanding front and any patch boundaries, populations exist at carrying capacity, so local density differences do not bias this measure of expansion rate.





 

\section{Results}


\subsection{Expansion on a linear gradient}

We first determine the greatest steepness that allows expansion on a linear gradient, $b_{crit}$. This $b_{crit}$ value varied depending on the genetic architecture modeled. The small effect and large effect regimes showed the highest $b_{crit}$ values, while both medium effect regimes had lower $b_{crit}$ values. The medium-large regime had the lowest $b_{crit}$ value of all genetic architectures modeled (Figure \ref{fig:linearspeed}). In all cases, as the steepness of the gradient approached $b_{crit}$, the rate of population growth decreased, indicating longer times to expand across these gradients. In the large effect regime for the steepest gradient on which expansion occurs ($b = 4$), only 2 replicates out of 10 expanded over the landscape to produce the calculated growth rate. These two replicates also did not immediately expand after the end of the burn-in, as did all other cases; they began to grow beyond the core $8300-13200$ generations later. A similar wait-time phenomenon was observed for the medium-large regime. In these cases, expansion began for all replicates within $4850$ generations (range $= 575-4850$, mean $= 2487.5$ generations). The total population size maintained across the landscape as well as average fitness were also lower as gradient steepness increased towards $b_{crit}$ (\color{red}Supplemental Figure of pop sizes and or fitness.\color{black} ).

\citet{Barton:2001} derives predictions for the value of $b_{crit}$, which depend on the genetic variance: $b_{crit} = \frac{V_G}{\sigma \sqrt{V_S}}$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of distance travelled by combining both gamete and offspring dispersal, i.e. $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma_{disperse}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{breed}^2}$ (weighting $\sigma_{breed}$ by half derives from the fact that gametes from only one parent move during the breeding life cycle). We find that the genetic variance across the landscape increases in scenarios of steeper environmental gradients (\color{red}Supplemental Figure . \color{black}). Because the genetic variance evolves differently on each gradient, we cannot make \emph{a priori} predictions for $b_{crit}$. We can calculate a $b_{crit}$ value using the genetic variance from the landscape core, but doing so creates a large underestimate of our realized $b_{crit}$ values (realized $b_{crit} = [4-4.5], [3.5-4], [3-3.5],$ and $[4-4.5]$; predicted $b_{crit} \approx 0.161, 0.125, 0.018,$ and $0.002$ for each genetic architecture respectively: small, medium-small, medium-large, and large). There are multiple reasons for this disparity in $b_{crit}$, which we consider in the Discussion.

\label{fig:linearspeed}
\end{figure}

For the same gradient values and genetic architectures, we examined the impact for dispersal distances to assess the ability for range expansion and the value of $b_{crit}$. The predicted $b_{crit}$ for these scenarios is approximately half of those for the smaller dispersal distance (realized $b_{crit} = [2-3], [2-3], [1-2],$ and $[1-2]$; predicted $b_{crit} \approx 0.082, 0.063, 0.009,$ and $0.0008$, respectively). %%; values which are approximately half of the predictions for the smaller dispersal kernel. 
Our realized $b_{crit}$ values in these larger dispersal cases again much larger than the predicted value using $V_G$ as estimated in the core, but were also much smaller than each respective $b_{crit}$ for the smaller dispersal cases (Figure \ref{fig:linearspeed}).	


\subsection{Expansion over heterogeneous, patchy landscape gradients} %% MCW: All gradients are heterogeneous.  How about discrete gradients?

%% Our measured $b_{crit}$ values define the slope of change over the environment on a linear gradient, but this gradient can consist of local heterogeneity while still overall possessing the same value of $b$ as measured across the entire landscape. This next set of simulations examines if and when the prediction from our measured $b_{crit}$ for each genetic architecture regime fails to describe the outcome of range expansion when we vary the degree of heterogeneity of change over the landscape. %% MCW: I'd say forget about measured bcrit and just talk about how bcrit changes with more discreteness

We now examine how the outcome of range expansion changes as landscape heterogeneity changes. We model two values of the overall gradient ($b = 0.0075$ and $b = 0.015$), both of which create a very weak gradient for which expansion is easily successful in the linear model. Holding this total gradient constant, we decrease the number of patches (increasing patch width) across the landscape from $1960$ (linear) to $2$ (two-patch model) and increase $\Delta z_{opt}$ to maintain the same overall gradient. Within a given simulation, $\Delta z_{opt}$ is constant, but across simulations $\Delta z_{opt}$ varies as the number of patches varies, i.e. $b = \Delta z_{opt}(number~of~patches-1)$. 

%% KJG can I sum this up without a figure??
On the weaker gradient ($b = 0.0075$), expansion occurs in all cases except the two patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 15$). One replicate did expand in this scenario for the medium-small regime after a $10,000$ generation delay, but none of the remaining 79 replicates succeeded in expanding into a second patch at this value of $\Delta z_{opt}$. The medium-large regime showed a significantly lower rate of growth than the other three regimes in the case of four patches on the landscape ($\Delta z_{opt} = 7.5$; Figure \ref{fig:hetspeed}). On the stronger gradient ($b = 0.015$), expansion success or failure resulted at similar $\Delta z_{opt}$ values, not at similar patch sizes. In other words, on a given overall environmental gradient, the ability to expand was driven by the local change in the environment, $\Delta z_{opt}$, not by the patch sizes that the landscape was divided into, nor the steepness of the overall gradient. The only difference on the steeper gradient is within the medium-large regime. In this case, population growth rate is slower for all decreasing values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ at and below $7.5$, whereas the weaker gradient only showed slowed expansion for $\Delta z_{opt} = 7.5$ (Figure \ref{fig:hetspeed}) This leads us to next test if the value of $\Delta z_{opt}$ is a sufficient predictor of expansion. %% MCW maybe delete- I like it here

%%On the stronger gradient ($b = 0.015$), the same patterns of expansion were found in terms of the $\Delta z_{opt}$ values between patches, but both the steeper two patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 30$) and five patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 15$) did not expand while the fourteen patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 7.5$) expanded at rates nearly identical to the weaker gradient two patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 7.5$). The only difference on the steeper gradient is within the medium-large regime where all decreasing values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ result in slower population growth, not only when $\Delta z_{opt} = 7.5$ (Figure \ref{fig:hetspeed}). The steepness of the overall gradient, $b$, thus does not successfully predict expansion on non-linear, heterogeneous gradients. This leads us to test if $\Delta z_{opt}$ can predict expansion.

\subsection{Expansion in a two patch model}

We examine the ability of each genetic architecture to expand in a two patch model for a range of $\Delta z_{opt}$ values between the patches. The steepest $\Delta z_{opt}$ ($15$) matches the $\Delta z_{opt}$ in the previous section's weak gradient two-patch model. We find a pattern similar in the two patch models to that on the linear gradients for the ability of each genetic architecture to successfully expand (Figure \ref{fig:waittimes}). The small effect regime can cross a steep $\Delta z_{opt}$ ($12.5$), but requires time beyond the end of the burn-in to adapt and expand into the second patch. The medium-small regime has more difficulty at this value of $\Delta z_{opt}$, with only 3 of 20 replicates succeeding, and the medium-large regime does not expand at this or the next smallest $\Delta z_{opt}$ value ($10$). However, the large effect regime shows a qualitative change in its expansion ability by being able to cross a $\Delta z_{opt}$ that the medium-large regime could not. This expansion ($\Delta z_{opt} = 10$) requires time beyond the end of the burn-in to adapt and expand (Figure \ref{fig:waittimes}). The same trend is seen with a larger dispersal distance, where increased dispersal makes expansion more difficult at the same values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ (Supplemental Figure S\ref{fig:waittimes200}).

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Mutations contributing to adaptation between patches}

We examine potential mechanisms for this qualitative change occurring across genetic architectures. First to understand the effect sizes of mutations contributing to adaptation in the second patch, we compare genotypic values of individuals in each patch near the boundary of the patches. Though we do not have the ability to track specific mutations, this analysis allows us to assess if few, large-effect mutations may have occurred at specific loci and contributed to adaptation in the second patch. To measure this, we take individuals present within $42$ cross sections on either side of the boundary between patches. We ignore individuals in the closest two cross sections, as these are most strongly subject to gene flow across the patches. In each of the two $40$ cross sections, we calculate the mean genotypic value for each locus across all diploid individuals, i.e. the numeric value of each allele at a given locus, resulting in $100$ locus values. In order to capture the effects directly contributing to adaptation in the new patch, this was done within $25$ generations of expansion, as determined by population size exceeding $4000$ individuals in the second patch. The pairwise difference between the two patches for these $100$ locus values are shown for all replicates that successfully expanded into the second patch in Figure \ref{fig:effectsizes}, and numeric values are listed in Supplemental Table \ref{tab:effects}.

In all cases of $\Delta z_{opt}$, we can see that the large effect regime contains the largest per-locus differences between the patches, and the medium-large regime the second-most. As $\Delta z_{opt}$ increases, %% mcw remove this sentence??: expansion no longer succeeds in the medium-large regime, and 
the large effect regime produces more and greater magnitude differences between the patches (Figure \ref{fig:effectsizes}).

\subsubsection{Constant $V_G$ versus constant $V_M$}

To examine if the amount of genetic variance, rather than mutational effect sizes, drives the ability for populations to expand and adapt, we analyze a subset of simulations with parameters (as described in the Methods) that created a constant $V_G$ instead of a constant $V_M$. With a decreasing $\alpha^2$, expansion became more difficult. Expansion no longer occurred for values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ where expansion was previously possible and became more difficult at lower values of $\Delta z_{opt}$ (Figure \ref{fig:waittimes}). This shows that genetic variance was not the only determining factor for expansion, but that the availability of mutations of larger effect determined the ability to adapt and expand into the second patch.

\subsection{Combination of patch size and $\Delta z_{opt}$}

We have thus far shown that overall $b$ matters for range expansion, but also that breaking this overall gradient into discrete patches can change the outcome of expansion. $\Delta z_{opt}$ directly impacts the outcome of expansion, but when the overall $b$ fails to predict expansion, is $\Delta z_{opt}$ a sufficient determinant of range expansion? We now investigate the ability of populations to expand across multiple patches of a constant $\Delta z_{opt}$, using $\Delta z_{opt}$ values that resulted in successful expansion in the two patch model ($\Delta z_{opt} = 5$ and $\Delta z_{opt} = 10$). We simulated between 5 and 1960 patches across the landscape, therefore increasing the overall $b$ as more patches are present on the landscape (e.g. Figure \ref{fig:stepschematic}, solid lines). Patch size decreases with more patches present across the landscape.

\caption[~- Population growth rates across patchy landscapes.]{Mean population growth rates (number of individuals per generation) across patchy landscapes having a constant $\Delta z_{opt}$ of either 5 or 10. The size of each patch directly correlates to the number of patches on the landscape. The overall gradient increases with additional steps and can be calculated as $b = \Delta z_{opt}(number~of~patches - 1)$.}
\label{fig:multistep}
\end{figure}

We find growth rates are faster for larger patches and with a lower $\Delta z_{opt}$ (Figure \ref{fig:multistep}). As patch size decreases, population growth rate decreases, and this decrease is faster for the higher value of $\Delta z_{opt}$. Greater dispersal distances increase population growth rate with larger patches. However, at smaller patch sizes, greater dispersal leads to slower growth rates. 
%%MCW - reword to talk directly about importance of patch width and explore why a bit:  In all cases, expansion fails on the linear gradient, as expected from our previous $b_{crit}$'s found on linear gradients. 
Despite the ability to expand in a two patch model for some of these $\Delta z_{opt}$ values, more patches with this change in optimum between them make a prediction based solely on $\Delta z_{opt}$ inaccurate for the outcome of expansion.

Though populations that fail to expand do appear below the critical value predicted, the observed and predicted upper limits of a non-zero growth rate are similar.

\section{Discussion} %% emphasize more the vg part and gen architecture results

Our study has investigated two major aspects of range expansion biology: how do landscape patchiness and genetic architecture change the outcome of adaptation and expansion. We find that both of these factors can impact the ability for populations to expand. Landscape heterogeneity shows a complex result where moving away from the realm of pure linear gradients or pure two patch models. In these intermediate scenarios, knowing either the overall gradient value or the degree of change in environment between patches is not sufficient to successfully predict the outcome of a range expansion. Genetic architecture shows an interesting pattern where adaptation and expansion can succeed from either many mutations of small effect or few of large effect, but that intermediate between these two regimes, adaptation becomes more difficult or even impossible.

The genetic architecture of the system impacted range expansion in all landscapes investigated, from linear gradients to two patch models to heterogeneous gradients consisting of many patches. In some cases the ability of a population to expand changed with the genetic architecture regime, but in other cases the genetic architecture only affected the speed at which range expansion proceeded and the fitness of populations during this expansion. %had something else in mind to maybe say here, just slipped my mind %% MCW wants to remove last clause about fitness?
Though genetic variance has been used previously for determining the critical steepness on linear environmental gradients \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997, Barton:2001, Bridle:2010, Polechova:2015}, we find that genetic variance is not always sufficient for describing this outcome. %% am not using mike's comment here because it DOES matter on the linear gradient too in our models, not just the patchy env!!
With equivalent genetic variance, the availability of larger effect mutations can lead to successful range expansion that is not possible via small effect alleles. % say something about genetic variance being higher on steeper gradients? maybe not, it's more a product of migration load there
Our simulation revealed two qualitatively different scenarios for which adaptation to newly encountered environments can proceed. First, sufficient numbers of small effect alleles can lead to successful expansion, and second, few alleles of sufficiently large effect can also lead to successful expansion. In the intermediate regimes between these scenarios, populations can lack mutations of either large enough effect or in large enough numbers, slowing or preventing range expansion. 



The structure of the landscape has a large impact on the outcome of expansion. The success of expansion over a linear gradient was determined by the steepness of the gradient, $b$. As expected, steeper gradients prevented range expansion. However, the critical values of $b$ at which expansion failed was not predicted by previous theory \citep{Barton:2001}. There are several major reasons for which these predictions are not expected to match our measured $b_{crit}$. Our two-dimensional landscape does not perfectly match the continuous space simulations from which these predictions derive. Perhaps more importantly, our simulations contain a core population that can never go extinct. Previous studies initiated populations on the environmental gradient, whereas ours begin in a core patch with a constant environmental optimum, and only outside of this core does the environment change. Therefore, even on an extremely steep gradient, global extinction cannot occur because the core will survive. Cases where a gradient may be too steep for a population to persist long enough in order to adapt is not an issue for our model because individuals dispersing from the core will repeatedly attempt to adapt to the new environment throughout the course of the simulation without being subject to extinction. 
%% Given this factor, our populations are able to continuously attempt expansion throughout the duration of the simulation even when it is not immediately possible.  and where otherwise existing solely on a gradient of this steepness might lead to extinction.

Furthermore, predicting expansion based on values of genetic variance was not useful, as even for cases of equal genetic variance but varying genetic architecture, the outcome of expansion differed. Genetic variance evolves differently on each gradient and is not alone a sufficient predictor of expansion. We did observe that with too large a genetic variance populations did not persist, presumably because most individuals were too different from their local phenotypic optimum, reducing fitness and therefore population density to non-sustainable levels.

We have clearly shown that increasing the patchiness across an environmental gradient can limit range expansion. Predicting where this patchiness creates a limit for range expansion is complicated. The change in environmental optimum between two patches strongly affects expansion ability, but is not the only characteristic of the landscape that matters. When patch sizes are smaller, migrants from nearby patches of different environmental optima are encountered more often as mates, leading to the influx of locally maladaptive alleles and reducing population fitness. At a range edge, this can make adapting to a new environment more difficult, as individuals are not even fully adapted to their local patch since the overall gradient is effectively steeper. This is similar to the result found by \citet{GarciaRamos:1997} where edge populations are pulled closer to the optimum of the denser, more central populations. Investigating the effects of migration barriers on heterogeneous landscapes as well as landscapes that do not always increase monotonically will be valuable. Moreover, incorporating the evolution of dispersal ability may produce different results as populations may adapt their dispersal ability to better match the level of patchiness in their environment and limit the detrimental effects of migration load.

%%\subsection{Conclusions}
Our results inform not only evolutionary biology in terms of understanding how range expansions proceed, but also invasion biology and conservation biology. Knowing how landscape heterogeneity and genetic architecture impact range expansion can help predict scenarios where invasive species may be more prone to rapid or reduced expansion capabilities. As many species adapt to climate change and habitat fragmentation, we can also gain insight into the processes that might be necessary for species to survive and understand which species or populations may be at greatest risk \citep{Chen:2011}. Our results from modeling patchy landscapes may also have bearing on studies of parapatric or sympatric speciation to understand situations where the evolution of reproductive isolation is beneficial in order to improve local adaptation to the environment. \color{red}need to work on closing paragraph a bit or add better last sentence I think\color{black} %% MCW - can you make any more concrete conservation recommendations? if not, maybe we don't need this paragraph here.


% future directions - 2d patchiness and more patchy patchiness, and non-monotonically increasing landscapes

% move to end of discussion: In particular, sharp changes in environmental optima, as we examine, may be similar to changes in temperature which are predicted to increase in extremes and variability with climate change. Though we have investigated these changes in optima spatially, temporal changes may have

%% Schiffers: Using an individual-based allelic model, we explore the effects of different landscape structures on the rate of adaptation to novel environments and investigate how these structures interact with the genetic architecture of the trait governing adaptation and the dispersal capacity of the considered species. Generally, we find that rapid adaptation is favored by a good match between the coarseness of the traits genetic architecture (many loci of small effects versus few loci of large effects) and the coarseness of the landscape (abruptness of transitions in environmental conditions). For example, in rugged landscapes, adaptation is quicker for genetic architectures with few loci of large effects, while for shallow gradients the opposite is true. Moreover, dispersal capacities affect the rate of adaptation by modulating the apparent coarseness of the landscape: a gradient perceived as smooth by species with limited dispersal capacities appears rather steep for highly dispersive ones. We also find that the distribution of evolving phenotypes strongly depends on the interplay of landscape structure and dispersal capacities, ranging from two distinct phenotypes for most rugged landscapes, over the co-occurrence of an additional third phenotype for highly dispersive species, to the whole range of phenotypes on smooth gradients.

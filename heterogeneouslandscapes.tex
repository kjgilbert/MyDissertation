\section{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}

% speciation, local adaptation, range expansion are all about adaptation to novel environments
%	in particular, adaptation in the face of gene flow

% it is still today a major question in evolutionary biology what alleles contribute to local adaptation
% and equally unknown (?) and much more hotly debated is how many genes are needed for speciation to occur? few or many? or a whole genome? or one magic trait?

% by examining range expansion over different types of heterogeneous environments and with different underlying genetic architectures, we investigate the ability for populations to colonize new habitat and adapt in order to undergo a species range expansion


%discuss the question of adaptation broadly - it's important in many aspects of evolution
The question of why species range limits exist has pervaded evolutionary biology for decades. Understanding populations' abilities to adapt to novel environments is key to this process, and is a major area of study across evolutionary biology in studies of speciation, local adaptation, invasive species, and conservation biology. 
Populations are known to locally adapt within their species range to survive across a range of disparate environments \citep{Kawecki:2004}. On a more extreme scale, populations may eventually span such dissimilar environments that they reach a point of sufficient differentiation to produce new, isolated species adapted to different environments \citep{Rundle:2005, Doebeli:2003}. Adaptation to new environments determines the capacity of invasive species to thrive \citep{Prentis:2008}, and the potential for success of new genetic diversity from attempts of assisted migration \citep{Aitken:2013}. 
Regardless of whether adaptation results in the formation of new species or differentiated local populations, it remains a major question in evolutionary biology as to which and how many genes contribute to local adaptation. 

% talk about genetic architecture
Many studies, both empirical and theoretical, examine genetic architecture and its role in the ability to adapt to a novel environment \citep{Yeaman:2015, Yeaman:2011, Carroll:2001, Holloway:1990, Peichel:2001, Bratteler:2006, Schiffers:2014}. It is known that a sufficient level of genetic variation, $V_G$, is necessary to provide the alleles required for adapting to a new environment. It was previously thought that many alleles of too small an effect may be swamped by gene flow before being able to contribute to sufficient local adaptation, but as shown by \citep{Yeaman:2015}, this effect is possible through transient processes subject to random genetic drift when rates and sizes of mutations and genetic redundancy are sufficient (though detecting the presence of such alleles remains a difficult task). It is clear however, that fewer loci of larger effect can contribute best to adaptation, which eventually lead to the building up of linked clusters of locally adapted alleles, often referred to as genomic islands of divergence \citep{Feder:2010}. Even when small effect alleles may contribute to adaptation, larger effect alleles build up and contribute to adaptive differences among populations \citep{Yeaman:2011}. As \citet{Renaut:2013} have shown in sunflower, genetic architecture plays a larger role in contributing to genomic divergence than does the geography of speciation. %make sure to go back and see what they mean by this "geography"
The details of genetic architecture are thus vital in studies of adaptation, and should not, nor need not, be ignored in today's era of genomic technologies. % eh, maybe remove the last part here, I am only doing a simulation study after all

% talk about landscape heterogeneity - in broad terms
Whether a certain genetic architecture will successfully contribute to adaptation in a new environment will also depend largely on the environmental difference at hand. There are clearly biological limits that exist in terms of adapting to environments of extreme difference in optimal phenotype, but within the realm of biological reality, there may still be limits to the change in environmental optimum to which a given genetic architecture allows adaptation. In the real world, environments are heterogeneous, and they change in multifarious ways over space, from gradual to sudden, and of minor or major magnitudes of change. \citet{Schiffers:2014} have investigated the role of adaptation across patches of heterogeneous environment, but it has not yet been investigated how the degree of change in these optima will impact the outcome of adaptation during range expansion.

MORE ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF HET LANDSCAPES EXIST BIOLOGICALLY

%The potential for genetic architecture underlying adaptation to interact with the environment to which populations are adapting is however less well understood. \emph{somewhere in here need to link better to the fact that I'm focusing on range expansions} %%

% talk about landscape heterogeneity in terms of range expansions
When considering environmental heterogeneity in terms of adaptation during range expansions, there are several important genetic processes that can lead to interesting hypotheses for adaptation across the landscape, making range expansions ideal for studying the combination of these effects. 
% Species exist on environmentally heterogeneous landscapes, and the degree of this heterogeneity can vary greatly within species ranges.
The characteristics of the environment available for a species to expand into plays an important role in the ability of populations to expand \citep{Aguilee:2012, Barton:2001, Pease:1989}. Increasing habitat heterogeneity, and thus heterogeneity in selective pressures, interacts with gene flow to influence the adaptive abilities of peripheral populations, and can in some cases inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987,Kirkpatrick:1997, Ronce:2001}. During a range expansion, small founder populations at the margin experience reduced effective population sizes and reduced efficacy of selection. When this process repeats over the course of an expansion, the process of gene surfing \citep{Klopfstein:2006} can increase the presence of deleterious alleles and cause an expansion load at the range margin \citep{Peischl:2013}. This process is examined in more detail by Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\color{red} \footnotesize hopefully submitted \normalsize \color{black}). %or remove this sentence and just talk about dispersal?
Due to reduced density at range margins, these populations experience gene flow at much higher proportions than any populations existing within the denser core os the species range. This asymmetric migration can behave in two disparate ways: introducing new genetic variation needed for further adaptation in an otherwise genetically depauperate population, or swamping locally adaptive alleles with foreign maladaptive alleles thus preventing further adaptation. Which of these processes occurs will depend on the details of migration rates, mutation rates, population sizes, and the degree to which the environment differs across the species range.

Previous theoretical studies have examined many of these aspects and their role in local adaptation at range margins during the expansion process. Higher gene flow has been shown to introduce more maladaptive alleles from greater distances and thus be more detrimental to the local population \citep{GarciaRamos:1997}. While others have shown the effect of evolutionary rescue from migration when marginal populations have small effective population sizes and behave as sinks \citep{Holt:1997,Gomulkiewicz:1999,Ching:2012}. Alternatively, if selection is strong enough or migration reduced enough, this can prevent the establishment of foreign alleles in a population allowing it to adapt sufficiently to local conditions \citep{Ronce:2001}. 

Foundational work in the field showed that on a linear environmental gradient, increasing steepness of the change in environmental optimum eventually leads to maladaptation at the margin and eventual extinction of the species \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997}. %Improving upon this study by allowing realistic and evolving genetic variance showed no limits to adaptation at a range margin, and a wider range of results when investigating temporally changing environments and varying population densities \citep{ polechova
Further investigations have improved upon this and shown the effects of density dependent selection \citep{GarciaRamos:1997} as well as stochastic effects on low density \citep{Bridle:2010}, temporal changes in environments \citep{Pease:1989}, differing dispersal parameters \citep{Aguilee:2012}, evolution of genetic variance \citep{Barton:2001,Polechova:2009}, and the impacts of genetic drift  \citep{Polechova:2015} on adaptation or the lack thereof at range margins. %\citet{Case:2000} also incorporated species competition, under which they found similar results only with a shallower environmental gradient needed to limit range expansion. Some of these models use the same linear gradient of an environmental optimum changing at a constant rate over continuous space, while others simulate adaptation to differing environmental optima across discrete space (habitat patches) within which  individuals of a patch possess no explicit spatial designation. The results of these discrete environment models also show the potential for species to either adapt and persist, exist as non-adapted generalists, or go extinct.
%  **** include this and improve on the summary of other studies? --> One may predict that a given difference in optimum phenotype can be attained equally from few loci of large effect or many of small effect, but such a process will clearly rely on important details of migration, mutation, selection, and genetic drift. (cite someone here?) Strong asymmetric migration can swamp locally beneficial alleles and prevent adaptation (cite Kirkpatrick and barton, and others). Weak selection and strong genetic drift can prevent beneficial alleles from establishing (true??). And mutation may drive the presence of genetic variation needed to allow adaptation to novel conditions.
These studies have all largely investigated adaptation in models of two discrete habitat patches of different environmental optima or across linear gradients in continuous space. Yet both of these situations differ largely from biological reality, where environmental changes exist in some combination of these two layouts: contiguous space with varying levels of gradual or abrupt environmental changes distributed patchily across space. %may occur more or less frequently in space and to a greater or lesser degree of difference in phenotypic optimum. 
These differences in landscape play a key role in the process of populations adapting because of their potential to interact with the effects of evolutionary processes at the range margin. 

% set up our hypotheses/goals
When discrete habitat types exist contiguously across space, will the dynamics of the system reflect those of the continuous or the discrete models? %The combination of such environmental landscapes however, has not been sufficiently explored. 
\citet{Barton:2001} suggested the ability of populations to persist across environments of accelerating gradients, but in depth examination of different types of environmental heterogeneities is warranted. Because discrete models have as of yet not extended past two patches, it is unclear what effects a third or additional patches may have on evolution and adaptation within the system when space is explicit within each patch. With larger environmental differences in optima, will only large effect mutations be able to contribute to local adaptation and small effect alleles still swamped at the range margin?

% this project's hypotheses
In this study, we test if different genetic architectures and landscape heterogeneities can interact and affect the outcome of adaptation during a species range expansion, and potentially even limit a species range expansion. We compare our results to predictions from \citet{Barton:2001} and the results of \citet{Bridle:2010} and \citet{Schiffers:2014} to assess the impacts of our further explorations into genetic architecture and environmental heterogeneity. 
% how we're going to test those hypotheses
To address this question, we simulate a spatially explicit and discrete two-dimensional landscape across which populations expand their species range and adapt to newly encountered environments. We model a range of genetic architectures for a quantitative trait to test for differences in ability to adapt to environments. We also compare this across environments that differ in their degree of environmental heterogeneity from few to many locations of change in environmental optima, as well as in terms of the magnitude of change for each of these optima. Examining the rate of range expansion and the time required for populations to colonize and adapt in new environments provides insight into the role of both genetic architecture and environmental heterogeneity in determining the success or failure of adaptation. Such results are highly informative for the field of evolutionary biology, and largely applicable in predicting the fate of many species across the globe requiring the ability to adapt in the face of disturbance and shifting species ranges due to climate change and other anthropogenic environmental perturbations.

% marginal populations thus often exist only as a sink, sustained by immigration until sufficient local adaptation is achieved. % and recovery from expansion load? -- refer to Ch 4 here, i.e. refer to our group project paper -- or just talk less about load since I'm not studying it in this paper
% When the population shifts to be a self-sustaining source, it escapes the effects of drift, and provides emigrants for further colonization and range expansion. This shift from sink to source also includes a shift away from asymmetric migration previously swamping locally adaptive alleles with foreign maladaptive alleles.

%Local adaptation within a species not only benefits populations in terms of fitness but also has repercussions for a species' global range. A species' range is defined in some cases by sharp visible boundaries, such as distinct geographical changes in landscape features, or equally understandable ecological reasons such as competitor occurrence or nutrient limitations. In instances where no such clear reason for a range edge exists, understanding what forces limit expansion and adaptation at the edge of a range becomes an evolutionary question \citep{Bridle:2007,Kawecki:2008,Excoffier:2009}. Barriers to dispersal may prevent expansion past the edge, however gene flow can also act to inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987,Kirkpatrick:1997}. This, in combination with different selective forces from environmental gradients across the landscape, may prevent expansion. The characteristics of the environment available for a species to expand into plays an important role \citep{Aguilee:2012,Barton:2001,Pease:1989}. Increasing habitat heterogeneity, and thus heterogeneity in selective pressures, interacts with gene flow to influence the adaptive abilities of peripheral populations \citep{Ronce:2001}.

% Under one of the first models to examine the question of adaptation across species ranges \citep{Kirkpatrick:1997}, it was shown that three different scenarios could result: species extinction, a limited species range, or unlimited expansion of a species. Other studies have examined scenarios similar to this model and incorporated more realistic simulation methods that were previously not investigated: density dependent selection \citep{GarciaRamos:1997,Gomulkiewicz:1999} as well as stochastic effects on low density \citep{Bridle:2010}, temporal changes in environments \citep{Pease:1989}, differing dispersal parameters \citep{Aguilee:2012}, and evolution of genetic variance \citep{Barton:2001,Polechova:2009}. \citet{Case:2000} also incorporated species competition, under which they found similar results only with a shallower environmental gradient needed to limit range expansion. Some of these models use the same linear gradient of an environmental optimum changing at a constant rate over continuous space, while others simulate adaptation to differing environmental optima across discrete space (habitat patches) within which  individuals of a patch possess no explicit spatial designation. The results of these discrete environment models also show the potential for species to either adapt and persist, exist as non-adapted generalists, or go extinct.

%Equally relevant to studying adaptation in a local adaptation or speciation context, is the study of adaptation during a species range expansion. As a species range expands, it encounters novel habitat to which it must adapt. Previous studies have shown that it is the ability of populations at range edges to adapt to these new environments that can determine the ability of a range to expand (citations). Not unlike parapatric speciation, this adaptation to new environments must occur in the presence of gene flow. Asymmetric gene flow at a range edge, however, can cause migration load that is particularly strong when an edge population is still a sink and requiring the influx of individuals to persist.

%Species range limits and the capacity for range expansion has long been a question in evolutionary biology. A species' range is defined in some cases by sharp visible boundaries, such as distinct geographical changes in landscape features, or equally understandable ecological reasons such as competitor occurrence or nutrient limitations. In instances where no such clear reason for a range edge exists, understanding what forces limit expansion and adaptation at the edge of a range becomes an evolutionary question \citep{Bridle:2007, Kawecki:2008, Excoffier:2009}. Barriers to dispersal may prevent expansion past the edge, however gene flow can also act to inhibit local adaptation in peripheral populations \citep{Slatkin:1987, Kirkpatrick:1997}. This, in combination with different selective forces from environmental gradients across the landscape, may prevent expansion.

\section{Methods}

%\subsection{Simulation Model}

We model a species range expansion over heterogeneous environments with individual-based, forward time simulations in the program \textsc{nemo} \citep{Guillaume:2006}. We vary two main parameters of interest: the magnitude and heterogeneity of change in environmental optimum in space and the genetic architecture underlying the quantitative trait that allows adaptation to the local environment. We also briefly compare these effects across two cases of small and large average dispersal distances. Our goal is to understand the impact and interactions of genetic architecture and the landscape heterogeneity over which individuals exist in terms of the outcome of range expansion and population adaptation.

We implement a modified version of \textsc{nemo} \citep{Guillaume:2006}, described in Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\Chapref{expansionload}), which allows for a large-scale, two-dimensional species range to be modeled with explicit space. This expands greatly upon existing 2-patch models with non-explicit space within each landscape patch and approaches a model of continuous space. Individuals are monoecious (hermaphroditic), obligately outcrossing diploids which possess a quantitative trait under balancing selection for the local environmental optimum. We initiate the population in a limited region for a burn-in to migration-mutation-selection equilibrium, after which populations expand into empty landscape of various types of heterogeneous environmental optima. Generations are non-overlapping and life cycle events occur in the order of breeding, dispersal, viability selection, and population regulation. We monitor the populations' abilities to spread across the landscape, and when successful, compare these scenarios in terms of expansion speed and fitness as they encounter environments of differing environmental optima to which they must adapt in order to further expand.


% now go into all the gory details:
\subsection{Landscapes}

To approximate continuous space and maintain a spatially explicit landscape with discrete populations, we implemented a large spatial grid of habitat patches in \textsc{nemo}. This bridges the gap between existing two-patch landscape models, where existence within either of these two patches is not spatially defined, and models of continuous space. The landscape is a rectangular grid of $40\times2000$ cells with a defined phenotypic optimum and carrying capacity for every cell in the landscape. 
This greatly builds upon the model of \citet{Schiffers:2014} which examined a grid of $16\times64$ cells. We term the leftmost $40\times40$ cells of the landscape the core, which is where the burn-in period occurs. After burn-in, expansion proceeds along the long ($x$) axis of the landscape into the remaining $40\times1960$ cells. The core consistently possessed a constant optimum phenotypic value of 0 to ensure that the population was well-adapted before populations expanded onto environmental gradients. In all cases, the environmental optimum only changed in one dimension over the axis of expansion (x-axis) and was constant over cross-sections of the landscape (y-axis). Terms for describing these landscape and other parameters are defined in Table \ref{tab:params}.

We examined several types of environmental heterogeneities across landscapes. These range from a linear gradient to only two patches each with a different local environmental optima, as well as combinations in between with multiple patches of constant environmental optima interspersed by sharp changes in the environment. This heterogeneity is representative of a multitude of possibilities in the real world. Many landscapes are patchy over space, for example patches of forest or meadow, and human-induced habitat fragmentation has only increased over time (citations). Similarly, many environments can change sharply in space, for example moving from forested habitat to above the timberline on elevational gradients. %Such patchy landscapes can exist on environmental gradients such as latitudinal (or altitudinal) temperature change.
Our modeled landscapes of constant environment interspersed among increases in environmental optima are thus not unrealistic biologically. 

To define each type of heterogeneous landscape we modeled, we describe three parameters: the number of changes in environmental optima over the landscape, the magnitude of each of these changes, and the total gradient value across the landscape, which can be calculated from the previous two values. We refer to each change in environmental optima on the landscape as ``steps" since the optimum is constant within a patch then changes in magnitude to the new optimum on a subsequent step. The number of changes, or steps, on the landscape is equivalent to describing the width of each step, since the landscape size is constant over all simulations and no changes occur perpendicular to the axis of expansion. The magnitude of change at a given step is referred to as the step's height, $h_{step}$ (Figure \ref{fig:stepschematic}). Therefore, a linear gradient would be one with $1959$ steps, each with a width of one cell.

Landscapes depicted with solid lines have the same step height across the landscape, but different total gradients, while the dashed and gray lines show how different numbers of steps of different height can make up a landscape with the same overall gradient. The landscape core in the first 40 units of the landscape is constant, and the linear gradient is where there is a step at every unit x on the landscape outside of the core.}
\label{fig:stepschematic}
\end{figure}


% maybe move to results
We first model linear gradients to determine the critical value, $b_{crit}$ for which expansion could no longer occur. From this we then break down this linear gradient into steps of environmental change to test at what point this prediction of $b_{crit}$ fails to identify successful expansions. This held the total gradient value constant, but changed the frequency of steps and thus also each step's height. To understand why this $b_{crit}$ prediction fails, we then investigate the role of step height alone on a two-patch landscape, and then elucidate the interaction of step height with step width in allowing adaptation and expansion to proceed across the landscape. All results present  the average value for a given parameter across the $y$-axis of the landscape for any given landscape location $x$. 

%%To first determine the factors underlying adaptation to a single, new environment, landscapes with one step were tested for $h_{step} = 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,$ and $15$. In these cases, $h_{total}$ = $h_{step}$, and essentially mimics a spatially explicit 2-patch model. % For the same total change in optimum over the landscape, but at the other extreme of heterogeneity, i.e. being linear, populations had no difficulty in expanding to fill the landscape when $h_{total} \sim 0.0025, 0.005,$ and $0.0075$.
%%Upon determining the outcomes of success or failure to expand across this single step, we then simulated landscapes with increasing frequencies of steps, while holding $h_{step}$ constant at either 5 or 10, within each simulation. Step frequencies ranging from 4 to 1,959 (linear) steps per landscape were compared, which can equivalently be described as scenarios where the width of a step (the number of cross sections between subsequent steps) ranges from 392 cross sections down to a single cross section between steps on the linear gradient. Because $h_{step}$ is held constant in these scenarios, the total change in environmental optimum across the entire landscape, $h_{total}$, differs across cases of different step frequencies and is simply the product of $h_{step}$ and the number of steps on the landscape. The scenario for $h_{total}$ being held constant is not shown, since linear gradients with $h_{total} = 5, 10,$ or $15$ ($h_{step} = 0.0025, 0.005,$ or $0.0075$) posed no difficulty for any of our simulated populations to expand across and adapt (see Supplemental Figure \color{red}1\color{black}). 
% if I have time for the simulations, add in the description of non-monotonic step landscapes

% Multiple different scenarios can represent the same total change in landscape optimum (Figure 1a) while the frequency of steps in space can also result in different total changes in landscape optimum (Figure 1b).

\subsection{Breeding \& Dispersal}
The large landscape grid allows regulation at a fine scale across the landscape, which is what allows our simulations to approach a continuous spatial model. Each landscape cell has a carrying capacity set at $K = 5$, which allowed for specification of a fine scale landscape to underly larger populations. We maintain larger effective population sizes through breeding and dispersal which both occur over regions of nearby cells. This creates a neighborhood size of approximately 250 individuals, calculated from \citet{Wright:1946}. 

The breeding window we introduced into \textsc{nemo} defines a given radius of cells around a focal cell from which an individual can find a potential mate during the breeding life cycle stage and is described in detail in Gilbert \emph{et al.} \Chapref{expansionload}. Because modeling a range expansion implies that there will often be lone colonists on the expansion front, this addition of a breeding window increases biological realism by allowing lone colonists on the range front to still potentially find a nearby mate, even if they are the sole inhabitant of their cell. This most closely resembles obligately outcrossing plants, who may receive pollen from nearby mates, but could also represent animals that search for mates nearby then return to their home territory. The probability of finding a mate is described by an approximate bivariate Gaussian defined by one standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution, $\sigma_{breed}$, where $f(x,y) \propto \exp{[-(\frac{\Delta x^2}{2\sigma_{breed}^2}+\frac{\Delta y^2}{2\sigma_{breed}^2})]}$ gives the distance traveled to search for a mate in a given direction $x$ and $y$. We discretized these probabilities by integrating the probability over each cell, and then weighted these probabilities by the number of potential mates in each cell within the breeding window. $\sigma_{breed}$ was set at one half of a cell length, and the maximum search radius for a mate was limited to $4\times\sigma_{breed}$. This produced a breeding window containing the 13 cells: the focal cell and its 12 surrounding cells. Individual fecundity was drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 4 to determine the number of offspring to be produced.

Dispersal occurred similarly to breeding, where a dispersal kernel was defined for forward rates of migration and discretized over cells on the landscape. This distribution was defined by $\sigma_{disperse} = 2\times$ cell size for the majority of simulations. Where specified, a larger dispersal kernel of $\sigma_{disperse} = 4\times$ cell size was implemented. An R wrapper package was created to calculate breeding and dispersal kernels, and to discretize these probabilities across the landscape, and is available online at https://github.com/kjgilbert/aNEMOne. C++ code for the modified version of \textsc{nemo} with a breeding window is available online at https://github.com/kjgilbert/NemoDispersalKernel.

 
\subsection{Genetic Architecture}
Individuals possess a quantitative trait that experiences balancing selection to adapt to the local environment. The quantitative trait, $z$, is controlled by 100 freely recombining loci. We held the total mutational variance, $V_m$, available to the system constant at $10^{-2}$, but varied the underlying genetic architectures contributing to the mutational variance. The number of loci, $L$, was also held constant at 100, thus to satisfy $V_m = 2 L \mu \alpha^2$, we varied the per locus mutation rate, $\mu$ and the variance in mutational effect sizes, $\alpha^2$. Four regimes of genetic architecture were investigated as follows. First, we employed one with small effect mutations and a higher mutation rate: $\mu = 10^{-2}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.005$. Second and third intermediate regimes set $\mu = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$, and $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$. The fourth regime allowed for the largest effect mutations to occur proportionally more often, yet exhibit less frequent mutations overall where $\mu = 10^{-5}$ and $\alpha^2 = 5.0$. \color{red}For a subset of simulations, we also compared the effect of holding $V_G$ constant by holding $\mu$ constant at $10^{-4}$ and varying $L$ and $\alpha^2$ at $L = 316$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$, and $L = 1000$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$.\color{black}


\subsection{Viability Selection}
Selection occurs only on survivorship, and not fecundity, throughout the simulations. Selection is stabilizing for the local environment's phenotypic optimum, with fitness of an individual defined by $\omega_z = exp[-\frac{(z-z_{opt})^2}{2V_S}]$, where $z$ is the quantitative trait value, $z_{opt}$ is the optimum phenotypic trait for a given cell on the landscape, and $V_S$ defines the width of the fitness function. We set $V_S = 7.5$, and environmental variance, $V_E$, to 1. This follows from choice of $V_S$ and $V_E$ in Gilbert \emph{et al.} (\Chapref{expansionload}) where we use $V_E$ to scale our parameter values.%as was derived from \citet{Kingsolver:2001} and \citet{Johnson:2005}.
 
 

\section{Results}

\subsection{Expansion on a linear gradient}

We first investigated the critical steepness of a linear gradient, $b_{crit}$. %The following results will present the outcome for simulations of $\mu = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$, and the remaining genetic architecture regimes will be discussed subsequently. 
We examined a range of gradient steepness, from $b = 1$ to $b = 5$, and found a $b_{crit}$ value below which expansion could successfully proceed, but that this $b_{crit}$ value varied depending on the genetic architecture modeled. For the genetic architecture of  $\mu = 10^{-2}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.005$, expansion occurred at and below $b = 4$, making $b_{crit}$ between 4 and 4.5. For the genetic architecture of  $\mu = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$, expansion occurred at and below $b = 3.5$, making $b_{crit}$ between 3.5 and 4. For the genetic architecture of  $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$, expansion occurred at and below $b = 3$, making $b_{crit}$ between 3 and 3.5. Lastly, or the genetic architecture of  $\mu = 10^{-5}$ and $\alpha^2 = 5.0$, $b_{crit}$ underwent a qualitative change, and expansion occurred again at and below $b = 4$, making $b_{crit}$ between 4 and 4.5.

In all cases where expansion occurred, it proceeded more slowly as the gradient steepness approached $b_{crit}$ (Figure \ref{fig:linearspeed}). For $\mu = 10^{-5}$ and $\alpha^2 = 5.0$, only 2 replicates out of 10 successfully expanded, producing the calculated growth rate, but these scenarios also spent a significant time after the burn-in of about 10,000 generations, without proceeding to expand across the landscape, and only then began to colonize empty landscape. A similar phenomenon was observed for $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$ where populations again showed time spent within the core before expansion occurred, but after the end of the burn-in. In these cases, expansion began for all replicates within 5,000 generations, but after an average waiting time of \color{red}2500 \color{black} generations. The total population size maintained across the landscape was also lower as gradient steepness increased towards $b_{crit}$ (\color{red}Supplemental Figure or maybe not supp fig of pop sizes.\color{black} ). 

\citet{Barton:2001} derives predictions for the value of $b_{crit}$, which depend on the genetic variance: $b_{crit} = \frac{V_G}{\sigma \sqrt{V_S}}$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of distance travelled by combining both gamete and offspring dispersal, i.e. $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma_{disperse}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{breed}^2}$. We find that the genetic variance across the landscape increases in scenarios of steeper environmental gradients (Supplemental Figure . ). Because the genetic variance evolves differently on each gradient, this is not a useful value in predicting $b_{crit}$ for our simulations, however we can attempt to predict a $b_{crit}$ using the genetic variance from the landscape core. Doing so estimates a $b_{crit}$ for each genetic architecture respectively: $\approx 0.161, 0.125, 0.018,$ and $0.002$ (for $\mu = 10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-4},$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively), a large underestimate of our realized $b_{crit}$ values. There are multiple reasons for this disparity in $b_{crit}$, which we consider in the Discussion.

For the same gradient values and genetic architectures, we examined the outcome for a dispersal kernel twice as large to assess how this impacted the ability for range expansion and the value of $b_{crit}$. The predicted $b_{crit}$ for these scenarios is $\approx 0.082, 0.063, 0.009,$ and $0.0008$, respectively; values which are approximately half of the predictions for the smaller dispersal kernel. Our realized $b_{crit}$ values in these larger dispersal cases again much larger than the predicted value using $V_G$ as estimated in the core, but were also much smaller than each respective $b_{crit}$ for the smaller dispersal cases. For the two largest mutation rate and lowest mutation effect size regimes, $b_{crit}$ was between 2 and 3, while for the two smallest mutation rate and largest mutation effect size architectures, $b_{crit}$ was between 1 and 2 (Figure \ref{fig:linearspeed}).

\subsection{Expansion over heterogeneous gradients}

Our measured $b_{crit}$ values define the slope of change over the environment on a linear gradient, but this gradient can consist of local heterogeneity while still overall possessing the same value of $b$ as measured across the entire landscape. This next set of simulations examines if and where the prediction from our measured $b_{crit}$ fails to describe the outcome of range expansion when we vary the degree of heterogeneity of change over the landscape. 

We choose a weak gradient value for which expansion on a linear gradient was successful and maintain the same total change in environmental optimum from one end of the landscape to the other. However, in these simulations, we divide the makeup of that change into different numbers of steps across the landscape. For a given simulation, the height of a step is constant, but across simulations the height of a step varies as the number of steps varies. The total change in optimum over the landscape was 15 units. For a linear gradient, this is equivalent to $b \approx 0.0075$, and for a non-linear gradient with steps we divide the landscape into a range of 979 steps down to 1 step which then varies step height from $h_{step} = 0.015$ to $15$. 

We found that expansion occurs in all cases except for the scenario when the landscape only consists of one step in environmental change, i.e. where $h_{step} = 15$. One individual replicate did expand above a single step of height 15, when $\mu = 10^{-3}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.05$, after 10,000 generations of remaining below the step, but this was one replicate out of 20 for that genetic architecture regime, and no simulation from the other regimes for each of their 20 replicates ever expanded past a step of this height. In this case, the total change in environmental optimum across the landscape is localized to this one step's location on the landscape. On this weak overall gradient, the prediction from our observed $b_{crit}$ on a linear gradient fails to predict expansion over an individual step, but further examining the ability to expand over one step as well as introducing additional steps on a steeper gradient also shows the failure of $b_{crit}$ as predicted from a linear gradient.
% does expansion take longer as more steps are added
% does fitness go down and variance up?

%%total h = 15 runs expand fine
%%one step h = 15 runs never expand (almost, except that one case)
%%where on the steppiness continuum does the b prediction from linear gradients fall apart?
%%total h is still the same in all these cases

\subsection{Expansion across one change in environmental optimum}

To investigate why $b_{crit}$ fails to predict expansion over 1 step in the optimum, we explore the role purely of step height by simulating models of one one step on the landscape (two habitat patches on either side) and vary the value of $h_{step}$. We compare the results for $h_{step} = 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,$ and $15$. From the previous result, we have shown that expansion does not occur across steps of height 15 (excepting 1 out of 80 replicates, 1.25\%).

In all genetic architectures, we find that expanding over one step of height 5 caused no difficulties and expansion proceeded immediately upon populations reaching the location of the step on the landscape. At $h_{step} = 7.5$, expansion becomes more difficult for one genetic architecture regime, $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$, but all replicates successfully expand within 2,500 generation of having reached the step. An interesting phenomenon is seen at $h_{step} = 10$, where expansion is minimally slowed (within 500 generations of reaching the step) for $\mu = 10^{-2}$, more substantially slowed (within 2,000 generations of reaching the step) for $\mu = 10^{-3}$, and then no expansion occurs within the duration of the simulations for all 20 replicates when $\mu = 10^{-4}$. However, at $\mu = 10^{-5}$, expansion again proceeds for 19 of 20 (95\%) replicates, with large variation in time spent waiting at the landscape step. For $h_{step} = 12.5$, expansion only occurs in the first two genetic architecture regimes of highest mutation rate, with substantial waiting time at the step (Figure \ref{fig:waittimes}).

\end{figure}

We also investigated these same single step height scenarios for simulations having larger dispersal distances. A larger dispersal kernel with $\sigma_{disperse}$ doubled showed that expansion over a single step became more difficult. The same overall trend is seen for the smaller dispersal kernel, that higher mutation rates make expansion easier and possible over steeper steps, and the same qualitative result of the fourth genetic architecture regime again being able to more easily expand over a step that was more difficult under the third genetic architecture regime is recapitulated. The observed wait times for replicates in these scenarios is presented in Supplemental Figure \ref{fig:waittimes200}.

\subsubsection{Mutations contributing to adaptation across a step}

We examine why expansion across steeper (taller) steps becomes more difficult as mutation rate decreases, but changes qualitatively again when large effect mutations are possible in the fourth genetic architecture regime. To investigate if this is due to the availability of mutations of different effect sizes, we compare individuals existing below and above the environmental step in the mean numeric difference of their allelic state for each of the 100 loci underlying the QTL. This is done within 25 generations of when expansion successfully occurs in order to capture the effects directly contributing to adaptation in the new environment above the step. The allelic value at each locus is averaged across all individuals existing each above and below the step and within $40\times40$ cells of the step, and excluding the $2\times40$ closest cells subject to the strongest migration load. Comparing these values across the step thus shows the differences in effects that have accumulated on a per locus basis to allow these populations to adapt to these two different environments.

This comparison shows that as we increase the variance in mutational effect size, more differences per locus accumulate of larger effect sizes. Figure \ref{fig:effectsizes}a shows per locus effect size differences of up to 2.69 %2.688124
%(mean = 0.023) %0.02276596
for the fourth genetic architecture regime of large variance in mutational effect size, while those regimes with smaller variance in mutational effect size show smaller effects per locus down to a minimum of 0.010, spread across more loci (Table \ref{tab:effects}). 
%: $\mu = 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$ maximum per locus difference of 1.14 %1.138611

%(mean = 0.019). % 0.01899583
%% I COULD SHOULD do stats on these differences
As the magnitude of difference in optimum across the step increases, the per locus effect sizes differences become larger within each regime that is successfully able to expand across the step. These differences become even more pronounced across genetic architecture regimes, where again the fourth regime generates the largest maximum difference above and below the step at few loci (Figure \ref{fig:effectsizes}). However, these large per locus differences only increase to the point at which these genetic architectures can no longer expand and adapt across the step into the new habitat ($h_{step} = 10$ and $h_{step} = 12.5$).

\subsubsection{Constant $V_G$ versus constant $V_M$}

To further investigate the role of larger effect mutations in enabling adaptation and expansion across a single step in the landscape, rather than maintaining a constant $V_M$ as all other comparisons have, we maintain a constant $V_G$. This is investigated across step heights of $h_{step} = 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,$ and $15$ with a mutation rate, $\mu$ held constant from our fourth genetic architecture regime. From \citet{Lande:1975} and \citet{Johnson:2005}, $V_M = 2 L \mu \alpha^2$ and $V_G \approx 2 L \sqrt{\mu \alpha^2 V_S}$, where $L$ is the number of loci and $\alpha^2$ the variance in mutational effect size. Holding the mutation rate, $\mu$ constant at $10^{-5}$ and the width of the fitness function, $V_S$ at 7.5, as is constant in all simulations, we thus approximate a constant $V_G$ by altering $L$ and $\alpha^2$. We compare two cases to the case already presented above with 100 loci and $\alpha^2 = 5.0$: a scenario of 316 loci with $\alpha^2 = 0.5$ and a scenario of 1000 loci with $\alpha^2 = 0.05$. This further comparison confirms whether adaptation across the step is allowed by many loci of small effect or few loci of large effect. $V_G$ as estimated in the resultant simulations did vary across scenarios, but was within the same order of magnitude, ranging from around 0.02 for 100 loci up to 0.35 for 1000 loci (Supplemental Figure \color{red}XX\color{black}). 

Whereas the case of 100 loci with $\alpha^2 = 5.0$ resulted in 19 out of 20 replicates successfully expanding over the step at a height of 10, with 316 loci and $\alpha^2 = 0.5$, only 4 out of 10 replicates expanded over the step of height 10. With 1000 loci, \color{red}fill this in\color{black} (Figure \ref{fig:constVG}). %%%% FILL IN 1000 loci results
All lower step heights successfully expanded across these comparison cases, and all larger step heights failed to expand.

\subsection{Combination of step height and step width}

The previous section showed which genetic architectures are able to expand over a single step of a given height. To further investigate the role of landscape heterogeneity, we investigate the ability of populations to expand across multiple steps of a constant height, for which expansion over a single step of this height did occur. We know from a weak overall gradient, that expansion across heterogeneous step landscapes only broke down when the individual step height became too large ($h_{step} = 15$ as shown above), but we now investigate the role of step heterogeneity on steeper overall gradients. In these cases, a constant step height of 5 and 10 were each used across the landscape. We simulated cases between 4 and 1959 (linear) steps across the landscape, therefore increasing the overall gradient as more steps are present on the landscape (Figure \ref{fig:multistep}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\makebox[\textwidth]{
        \includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{Figures/UpdatedGrowthRatesByStep.pdf}}
\caption[Population growth rates across multi-step scenarios.]{Population growth rates across multi-step scenarios having either a constant step height of 5 or 10. The width of each step directly correlates to the number of steps on the landscape, and the overall gradient value for the landscape is equal to the step height times the number of steps.}
\label{fig:multistep}
\end{figure}

We find that for step heights of 5, population growth rate decreases as more steps exist on the landscape. As shown from our previous investigations of linear gradients, step height of 5 on a linear gradient ($b = 5$) is too steep for expansion to occur. Immediately beyond this limit however, when each step is a width of two units instead of 1, expansion is again possible. With the larger dispersal kernel, the first occurrence of expansion is not until steps are of width three cells or greater. The point at which expansion no longer occurs is consistent across genetic architecture regimes for $h_{step} = 5$.

In the parameter space where expansion is possible, the rate of population growth differs across genetic architecture regimes, and undergoes a qualitative shift when the width of a step is around $14 - 20$ cells. Between step widths of 2 (3 for large dispersal kernel) and $14 - 20$, the first genetic architecture regime of $\mu = 10^{-2}$ and $\alpha^2 = 0.005$ shows the slowest growth rates, yet switches to become one of the fastest growing scenarios when steps are wider than 20 units. The opposite is true for the third and fourth genetic architecture regimes which grow fastest out of all regimes between step widths of 2 (3 for large dispersal kernel) and $14 - 20$, but are slower than the other regimes when steps are wider than 20 cells.

For step height of 10, only two genetic architectures were investigated (first and fourth regime). Under the first regime, expansion succeeds when step widths are 3 cells or greater for either dispersal kernel. However, for the fourth regime, expansion does not succeed until steps are of width 7 or greater under the small dispersal kernel and 9 or greater under the larger dispersal kernel. There is no consistent switch in speed of these regimes with wider step widths, however the larger dispersal kernel is faster on wider steps for the first regime, yet slower for the fourth regime, up until the point of reaching a similar speed on the widest steps.

% report something like ratio of width to height for expansion ability?


\section{Discussion}

we don't match bcrit expectations for several reasons
the major one begint hat there is no useful vg definition
it is defined on the landscape when it gets too steep
because vg can evolve

for our observed bcrit, we see differences among genetic architectures
shows that a certain amount of vg is required in order to successfully adapt to a new habitat
or that there is another regime of adaptation that depends on mutational input, and is slower but allows adaptation again on more steep landscapes

these also differ from barton and kp because there is a constant landscape core where even if the gradient is too steep to initially adapt to or across, the core allows continued attempts to expand across and onto it



to understand why adaptation does or does not succeed and when the bcrit prediction fails, looking at landscapes that are more heterogeneous within an overall gradient allows us to test whether it is the magnitude of change in optimum over space or the size of local habitat that limit adaptation and expansion




% then a section on step height and width?
why does the steppiness matter?

step height

	one step analyses show height matters
	need the mutations or standing variation to adapt


step width

	but making it over one step of a given height doesn't ensure that you can make it over multiple steps of that height
	too many steps of a given height again prevents expansion
	
	so step width also matters
		why?
		migration load from other steps
		need recovery that mig load prevents (local adaptation not possible)
		
		ratio of step width to step height that is the critical value
		or ratio of step width to total gradient that is the critical value?






	looking at 1 step cases, can see that expanding over them depends on the distribution of mutations and\/or the standing genetic variance
	larger effect mutations at fewer loci contributed to adaptation across the step in one step cases






multistep stuff heights 5 and 10
on height 5:
once steps are wide enough, about greater than width 14ish, the rank order of growth rate across gen arch changes
this is about the same for disp 200
gen arch 10^-2 is slowest when there are lots of steps, then 10^-3 then 10^-5, THEN 10^-4 fastest WHYYYY?
past that switch point when steps are plenty wide, 10^-5 is slowest, followed closely or matched by 10^-4

with the larger disp kernel, ability to expand stops sooner, at step width 2 growth rate is zero (3 can go) whereas on disp 100 all could still expand, just slowly on step width 1


on height 10:
only 2 cases expanded and growth rate approached zero much sooner (total gradient value of xx, step width of yy)

growth rate was higher for disp 200 in gen arch 10^-2, but was almost the same for 10^-5, because in the latter case this supports our result of that growth depending on a mutation arising to get over a step, not on the distance able to be traveled and colonized, which is what drives it when expansion is easier in the other genetic architecture (orange squares versus plus signs)



\subsection{Impact of dispersal distances}

larger dispersal distances make everything more difficult (make sure this is true)

because more migration load

what are the new b-crits?

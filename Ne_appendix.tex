\caption[RMSE compared across sample sizes.]{RMSE compared across our standard sample size of 250 (filled points) versus a smaller sample size of 50 individuals (open points). \textsc{ldne} (blue) and \textsc{mlne} likelihood (red) and moment (dark red) methods are compared across isolated populations at $N_e = 50$ and 500, and three migration scenarios each at $N_e = 50$ and 500. The three migration scenarios are shown in order from left to right for each method: the island model demography within metapopulation sampling scenario at $m = 0.01$, sink receiving immigrants at $m = 0.1$ from metapopulation at migration rate $m = 0.1$, and within metapopulation $m = 0.1$, respectively. One result for \textsc{ldne} at $N_e = 500$ showed a reduced RMSE for a population sampled within the metapopulation due to fewer infinite $N_e$ estimates and increased precision around a more biased $N_e$ estimate that nevertheless improved RMSE. Each point represents the average performance for a method over 100 replicate simulations.}

Island model scenarios are in the left panels and stepping stone (IBD) scenarios are in the right panels. Note that a migration source cannot be provided when the whole metapopulation is sampled as one, so these cases are only single populations experiencing migration either as a sink from the metapopulation or a population within the island model or stepping stone metapopulations.}

\caption[Comparing migration rates for ongoing versus historic migration scenarios.]{Comparing migration rates for ongoing versus historic migration scenarios estimated from \textsc{mlne}'s likelihood and moment methods. Green horizontal lines show the true migration rate, where the left half of each panel is the case where migration rate is constant and the right half of each panel shows the same populations except that migration stopped over the span of the temporal sampling. Therefore the true migration rate in the right half of each panel should reflect zero (green line) and the historic migration rate is shown by the horizontal gray line. Cases shown are sink populations and populations within the island model metapopulation where migration rates between the focal and source population are labeled in the center row and correspond to the panels both above and below each label. Population size of 50 is shown in the top row while 500 is shown in the bottom row.}

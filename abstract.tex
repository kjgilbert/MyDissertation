Evolution is driven by four major processes: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Each of these plays a major role in determining the future of species and whether populations will survive, adapt, or go extinct. My thesis has addressed multiple questions relevant to these processes. I begin with a study on the estimation of effective population sizes (Chapter 2). Effective population size is proportional to the amount of genetic drift a population experiences, yet the presence of gene flow can affect measures of drift and thus estimates of population size. I have tested existing estimation methods using simulated data to understand the impact of migration on accuracy of estimates. I then discuss two studies of species range expansions and the roles of migration, mutation, and environment on expansion dynamics. The first of these examines the ability of species to expand over heterogeneously changing environmental optima (Chapter 3). Expansion requires that edge populations adapt to new conditions, but under interesting conditions of smaller effective population sizes where the strength of selection is reduced. The second of these explores the actions and interactions of fitness reductions due to deleterious mutations (mutation load) and due to immigration (migration load) on populations at the expanding edge of a species range (Chapter 4). My final study assesses the reproducibility of analyses using the common algorithm \textsc{structure} (Chapter 4). This research investigates the ability of stochastic analysis methods to recreate identical results from the same data, and elucidates the reasons for cases where reproduction failed. In sum, my thesis contributes to our understanding of how gene flow, population size, landscape heterogeneity, and mutation interact and impact the genetics of populations and thus the fate of biodiversity.
